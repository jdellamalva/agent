# LLM Agent Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building a two-layer LLM agent architecture:

### Base Agent (Stable Core)
A fully-featured agent that operates in a continuous cycle and can manage multiple codebases:
1. **Think**: Process Slack @agent callouts via OpenAI API to generate structured instructions
2. **Act**: Execute deterministic code based on LLM-generated instructions via switch statement
3. **Observe**: Feed execution results back as context for the next cycle

### Customization Layer (User-Specific Extensions)
Each user deploys their own agent instance with:
- **Personal Infrastructure**: User-provided API keys, Firebase for persistent memory
- **Custom Actions**: User-specific modifications and extensions to base functionality
- **Independent Evolution**: Each agent can learn and adapt without affecting others
- **Dynamic Data**: Web scraping (Puppeteer) for real-time pricing, rate limits, etc.

**Key Capability**: The base agent provides a stable foundation while the customization layer enables unlimited personalization and autonomous evolution.
