# LLM Agent Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building an LLM agent that operates in a continuous cycle and can manage multiple codebases:
1. **Think**: Process Slack @agent callouts via OpenAI API to generate structured instructions
2. **Act**: Execute deterministic code based on LLM-generated instructions via switch statement
3. **Observe**: Feed execution results back as context for the next cycle

**Key Capability**: The agent can create, modify, and manage any codebase - including its own code, new projects, existing repositories, and multi-project workflows.

## Current Status
üéâ **Phase 3 COMPLETE & TESTED!** - Advanced OpenAI Integration Working Perfectly

## Phase 4: Action System (Switch Statement Engine)
- [ ] **Command Schema**: Define structured format for LLM-generated commands
- [ ] **Switch Statement Core**: Implement main switch statement for command routing
- [ ] **Base Actions**: Create initial set of deterministic actions:
  - [ ] File system operations (create, read, update, delete files/directories)
  - [ ] Git operations (clone, commit, push, pull, branch management)
  - [ ] API call action
  - [ ] Data retrieval action
  - [ ] Code analysis action (parse, lint, test)
  - [ ] Project scaffolding action
  - [ ] Package management action (npm, pip, etc.)
  - [ ] Shell command execution action
  - [ ] Wait/delay action
- [ ] **Action Registry**: System to register and discover available actions
- [ ] **Parameter Validation**: Validate action parameters before execution
- [ ] **Workspace Management**: Handle multiple active projects/repositories

## Phase 5: Multi-Codebase Management & Self-Modification
- [ ] **Repository Management**: Clone, manage, and switch between multiple repositories
- [ ] **Project Templates**: Create and use templates for new project scaffolding
- [ ] **Workspace Isolation**: Safely manage multiple projects without conflicts
- [ ] **Version Control Integration**: Full Git workflow automation
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Handle package.json, requirements.txt, etc. across projects
- [ ] **Self-Modification Actions**: Special actions for modifying the agent's own codebase:
  - [ ] Code generation action (for new agent actions)
  - [ ] Hot reload system (safely load new actions without restart)
  - [ ] Action versioning (track and manage different versions of actions)
  - [ ] Safety checks (validate generated code before execution)
  - [ ] Rollback mechanism (revert to previous action versions)
- [ ] **Cross-Project Operations**: Actions that work across multiple codebases
- [ ] **Project State Tracking**: Maintain state for each managed project

## Phase 6: Advanced Codebase Operations
- [ ] **Code Analysis Pipeline**: Static analysis, complexity metrics, dependency graphs
- [ ] **Automated Testing**: Run tests across different projects and languages
- [ ] **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, security scanning
- [ ] **Refactoring Operations**: Automated code improvements and migrations
- [ ] **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate docs from code comments
- [ ] **Build System Integration**: Handle various build tools (webpack, gradle, make, etc.)

## Notes
- Consider using TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement comprehensive logging from day one
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- Security should be built-in, not bolted-on
- Test the self-modification capabilities thoroughly before production use
- **Multi-project isolation is critical** - one project's issues shouldn't affect others
- **Version control everything** - all agent modifications should be tracked
- **Sandbox dangerous operations** - especially when working with unknown codebases
- **JEST TESTING GOTCHA**: Jest doesn't support TypeScript path aliases (@utils, @integrations) out of the box. The `moduleNameMapping` property doesn't exist in Jest. Use relative imports (../src/utils/logger) in source files when having Jest test issues, or create a working Jest module mapping configuration. Don't get stuck iterating on this - the working pattern is relative imports like the infrastructure.test.ts file.
