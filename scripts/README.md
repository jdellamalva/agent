# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for development and maintenance tasks.

## Guidelines

- **Temporary scripts**: Add `.temp.` to filename (e.g., `analyze-deps.temp.js`)
- **Permanent tools**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `check-unused-imports.js`)
- **Documentation**: Add comments explaining the purpose of each script

## Current Scripts

*No permanent scripts currently. Temporary scripts are automatically cleaned up.*
