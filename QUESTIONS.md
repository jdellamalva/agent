# LLM Agent Development Questions

## Evolutionary Swarm System Questions

### Engram Design & Architecture
1. **Engram Composition**: Should engrams be pure natural language, structured data, or a hybrid format? How do we balance human readability with computational efficiency?

2. **Engram Size Economics**: What's the optimal cost function for engram size? Should it be linear, exponential, or have different tiers based on content type?

3. **Bioavailability Constraints**: How do we set the hard maximum limits for engram size? Should this be adjustable per user or globally standardized?

### Speciation & Evolution
4. **Tag Evolution**: Should the tag system itself evolve (new tags emerge, old ones disappear), or should it be more static? How do we handle agents that might bridge multiple niches?

5. **Reproductive Barriers**: What's the threshold for "too different to reproduce"? Should this be a hard cutoff or a gradual fertility decline?

6. **Cross-Species Genetic Flow**: How do we manage beneficial mutations that could help multiple species? Should there be rare cross-species breeding events?

### Fitness & Selection
7. **Fitness Function Conflicts**: When user preferences conflict with global optimization (e.g., user wants speed but global system needs efficiency), how do we resolve these tensions?

8. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: How do we handle trade-offs between competing objectives (cost vs. quality vs. speed)? Should we use Pareto optimization?

9. **Evolutionary Timescales**: How do we balance rapid adaptation (short generations) with stability (avoiding thrashing)? Should different types of tasks have different evolutionary rates?

10. **Context-Dependent Fitness**: How do we adapt fitness functions based on the specific problem domain or user context?

### Governance & Control
11. **Mothership Governance**: Who controls the global fitness functions and ethical constraints? How do we prevent the mothership from becoming a single point of failure or control?

12. **Ethical Evolution Boundaries**: What are the hard limits on what agents can evolve toward? How do we prevent harmful or malicious evolutionary paths?

13. **User vs. Global Optimization**: How do we balance individual user needs with global system efficiency?

### Privacy & Security
14. **Encrypted Evolution**: How do we perform genetic operations (crossover, mutation) on encrypted engrams without decrypting them?

15. **Differential Privacy**: How do we ensure that aggregate evolutionary data doesn't leak individual user information?

16. **Opt-out Mechanisms**: How do users remove their data from the global evolutionary pool if they change their minds?

### Performance & Scalability
17. **Population Management**: How do we determine optimal population sizes for different problem domains?

18. **Computational Resources**: How do we distribute evolutionary computation across the network efficiently?

19. **Convergence Detection**: How do we know when an evolutionary branch has reached a local optimum and needs diversification?

### Integration & Compatibility
20. **Version Compatibility**: How do we handle evolutionary compatibility when the base agent system is updated?

21. **Legacy Engrams**: How do we migrate or adapt old engrams when the system architecture changes?

22. **Rollback Mechanisms**: How do we revert to previous evolutionary states if new generations perform poorly?

## General Architecture Questions

### Provider Abstraction
23. **LLM Provider Interface**: What's the minimum viable interface for LLM providers? How do we handle provider-specific capabilities?

24. **Channel Provider Interface**: What's the minimum viable interface for message channels? How do we handle channel-specific features?

25. **Configuration Management**: How do we handle provider-specific configuration while maintaining a unified interface?

### Action System
26. **Action Registry**: Should actions be discovered dynamically or pre-registered? How do we handle action conflicts?

27. **Parameter Validation**: How do we validate action parameters across different provider types?

28. **Error Handling**: How do we handle provider-specific errors in a unified way?

### Testing & Validation
29. **Mock Strategy**: How do we create realistic mocks for evolutionary testing?

30. **Performance Benchmarking**: How do we establish baseline performance metrics for evolutionary comparison?
